Traditional ML vs Physics-Informed Neural Networks   Traditional ML  Data Only   Loss Function MSE = Σ(y\_pred - y\_true)² Only Data-driven  Physics-Informed Neural Networks  Data + Physical Laws   ∂u/∂t + N[u] = 0  Loss Function MSE = MSE\_data + MSE\_physics Data-driven + Physics-informed  • Requires large amounts of data • May violate physical laws • Works well with limited data • Guarantees physical consistency
